#Â Commenting

For some reasons you may want to delete some lines/parts of line after the preprocessing part, I added it specially for documenting some macros i make, it's pretty weird to get the whole comments about the macros in the bf code.

Comments only work however outside of macros, i didn't find any usecase of allowing it inside macros.

Example
```bf
;This macro add1 to the current cell, and i wont be in the bf code ;)
#D ADD1 : +#
```
